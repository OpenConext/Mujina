  Configurable Identity and Service Provider built with OpenSAML & Java Spring Boot
</pre>

Mujina
======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ministryofjustice/laa-saml-mock.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ministryofjustice/laa-saml-mock)
[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/ministryofjustice/laa-saml-mock/coverage.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/ministryofjustice/laa-saml-mock)

Mujina is a SAML2 Identity and Service Provider (IdP & SP). 

Note that backward incompatibilities were introduced in version 5.0.0. If you want to migrate from pre-5 versions to the post-5 versions 
then the following has changed:
 
* We no longer use Tomcat, but standalone Spring boot applications
* The API has changed for all end-points requiring a single value (e.g. String or boolean) and only that value is required in the request body. See the API documentation below.
 
Characteristics of both the IdP or SP can be runtime changed with the REST API. 

Mujina is used to test the SURFconext middleware which enables Dutch educational services to use cloud based SAAS-services.

Features
--------
- A SAML2-compliant Identity Provider. The IdP will authenticate known users, providing known attributes to the SP. The REST api allows for the manipulation of:
  * user credentials (either a specific username & password or allow any username and password)
  * user role
  * any user attributes
  * signing certificate
  * entityID
  * ACS endpoint
  * signature Algorithm

- A SAML2-compliant Service Provider. The SP displays the attributes as these were received from an IdP. The REST api allows for the manipulation of:
  * entityID
  * signing certificate  
  * SSO Service URL
  * signature Algorithm

Defaults
--------
The default Identity Provider configuration is as follows:

* The Entity ID is "http://mock-idp"
* The signatureAlgorithm is "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"
* It has a user with login "admin" and password "secret" with roles ROLE_USER and ROLE_ADMIN
* It has a user with login "user" and password "secret" with role ROLE_USER
* It has no default attributes. Attributes are always stored as lists. Even when they contain a single value.
* There is a default certificate and private key available
* By default the ACS endpoint should be provided by the SP as an attribute in the AuthnRequest.
  If the ACS endpoint is set using the IdP api this is not necessary. Use of the api overrides values set in AuthnRequests

The default Service Provider configuration is as follows:

* The Entity ID is "http://mock-sp"
* The signatureAlgorithm is "http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more#rsa-sha256"
* There is a default certificate and private key available

In this document you will find some examples for overriding the default configuration.
After you override configuration you can go back to the default using the reset API.

Build Mujina
---------------

[Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org) is needed to build and run Mujina.

The build dependencies are hosted on https://build.openconext.org/repository/public/
(and will be fetched automatically by Maven).

Run the IDP 
-----------------------

```bash
mvn clean install
cd mujina-idp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then, go to http://localhost:8080/. If you want the application to run over https, please refer
to the [spring boots docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-embedded-servlet-containers.html#howto-configure-ssl).

Run the SP
----------------------

```bash
mvn clean install
cd mujina-sp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Then, go to http://localhost:9090/. You can access the secure page and will be redirected to the IdP, where you can
login with username admin and password secret.

## [Private signing key and public certificate](#signing-keys)

The SAML Spring Security library needs a private DSA key / public certificate pair for the IdP / SP which can be re-generated
if you want to use new key pairs.

```bash
openssl req -subj '/O=Organization, CN=Mujina/' -newkey rsa:2048 -new -x509 -days 3652 -nodes -out mujina.crt -keyout mujina.pem
```

The Java KeyStore expects a pkcs8 DER format for RSA private keys so we have to re-format that key:

```bash
openssl pkcs8 -nocrypt  -in mujina.pem -topk8 -out mujina.der
```
 
Remove the whitespace, heading and footer from the mujina.crt and mujina.der:

```bash
cat mujina.der |head -n -1 |tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n'; echo
cat mujina.crt |head -n -1 |tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n'; echo
```

Above commands work on linux distributions. On mac you can issue the same command with `ghead` after you install `coreutils`:

```bash
brew install coreutils

cat mujina.der |ghead -n -1 |tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n'; echo
cat mujina.crt |ghead -n -1 |tail -n +2 | tr -d '\n'; echo
```

Add the mujina key pair to the application.yml file:

```yml
idp:
  private_key: ${output from cleaning the der file}
  certificate: ${output from cleaning the crt file}

sp:
  private_key: ${output from cleaning the der file}
  certificate: ${output from cleaning the crt file}
```

Resetting the IDP
-----------------

This API is available on both the IDP and the SP.

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X POST \
        http://localhost:8080/api/reset
```

Changing the entityID
---------------------

This API is available on both the IDP and the SP.

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X PUT -d "myEntityId" \
        http://localhost:8080/api/entityid
```

Setting the Signature Algorithm
-------------

This API is available on both the IDP and the SP.

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X PUT -d "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1" \
        http://localhost:9090/api/signatureAlgorithm
```        

Changing the signing credentials (Both IDP and SP)
--------------------------------

This API is available on both the IDP and the SP.
The certificate should be in PEM format.
The key should be in base64 encoded pkcs6 DER format.

```bash
export CERT=MIICHzCCAYgCCQD7KMJ17XQa7TANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQUFADBUMQswCQYDVQQGEwJO\

        -X POST -d "{\"certificate\": \"$CERT\",\"key\":\"$KEY\"}" \
        http://localhost:8080/api/signing-credential
```

Setting attribute foo to bar (e.g. urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:foo to bar)
-------------------------------------------------------

This API is only available on the IDP. **Note:** An attribute is always a list.

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X PUT -d '["bar"]' \
        http://localhost:8080/api/attributes/urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:foo
```

Removing an attribute
---------------------

This API is only available on the IDP.

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X DELETE \
        http://localhost:8080/api/attributes/urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:foo
```

Adding a user
-------------

This API is only available on the IDP.

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X PUT -d '{"name": "hacker", "password": "iamgod", "authorities": ["ROLE_USER", "ROLE_ADMIN"]}' \
        http://localhost:8080/api/users
```

Setting the authentication method
---------------------------------

This API is only available on the IDP.

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X PUT -d "ALL" \
        http://localhost:8080/api/authmethod
```

Setting the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) endpoint
---------------------------------

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X PUT -d "https://my_sp.no:443/acsendpoint_path" \
        http://localhost:8080/api/acsendpoint
```

The authentication method API has two possible values.

* USER
* ALL

The setting is configurable in the application.yml
```
# Authentication method ALL for every username / password combination and USER for the configured users
auth_method: USER
```

The USER setting requires a valid user to be known in Mujina's IdP and the ALL accepts everything.

The ALL setting allows any username and password combination.
As a side effect, the urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:uid attribute is set to the username each time a user logs in.

Setting the SSO Service URL
-------------

This API is only available on the SP.

```bash
curl -v -H "Accept: application/json" \
        -H "Content-type: application/json" \
        -X PUT -d "http://localhost:8080/SingleSignOnService/vo:test" \
        http://localhost:9090/api/ssoServiceURL
```
